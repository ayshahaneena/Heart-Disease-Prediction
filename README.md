# Heart Disease Prediction Model
Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project implements a logistic regression model for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on several medical attributes. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, etc., and aims to classify individuals as either having heart disease or not.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is obtained from kaggle and it contains 303 instances with 13 features. Each instance represents a patient.

## Requirements
- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn



## Model Evaluation
The performance of the logistic regression model is evaluated using metrics accuracy.
